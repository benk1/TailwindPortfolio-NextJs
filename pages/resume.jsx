					I am a Software Engineer specializing in Web development, with a
					strong focus on front-end technologies like React,NextJs and Redux and
					other modern front-end technologies. Recently, I worked on an
					AI-driven web platform (twoday AI Agent), developing an interactive
					user experience that gained over 100 clients across Finland. <br />I
					have participated in multiple projects during my past experience where
					teamwork and individuality were both crucial. I am hard working, quick
					to learn with a positive attitude under pressure. I have worked with
					different tools from my past experience and been able to adopt
					quickly. I have developed good communication skills and adaptability
					to different working environments.
