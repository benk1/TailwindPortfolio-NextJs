						About
					</p>
					<h2 className="py-4">Who I Am:</h2>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						I’m a front-end-focused web developer based in Helsinki, with a
						passion for building responsive,accessible,and visually appealing
						applications using React, Next.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My
						journey into web development began in 2017, and since then, I’ve
						worked across multiple industries and platforms from CMS websites to
						full-stack appplications integrated with APIs and backend services.
						After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering in Information
						Technology from Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in
						Finland, I kicked off my career with hands-on experience in Ruby and
						Ruby on Rails as a trainee at Sibesonke Ltd in Espoo. Since then,
						I’ve collaborated with companies like <b>Integrify Oy</b>,{' '}
						<b>BearIT Oy</b>, and most recently, <b>twoday Oy</b>, contributing
						to a range of impactful projects as a consultant and developer.
					</p>
					<h2 className="py-4">What I Do Best:</h2>
					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						<li>
							Building clean, accessible, easy to use interfaces that make the
							user experience smooth.
						</li>
						<li>
							Collaborating with teams to deliver elegant, scalable solutions.
						</li>
						<li>Writing maintainable, tested, and well-structured code.</li>
						<li>Always staying curious and learning new tools when needed.</li>
						<br />
						I’ve also explored backend technologies and databases like MySQL,
						MongoDB, and I regularly use Git for version control. Tools like VS
						Code, IntelliJ, and Figma are part of my daily workflow.
					</p>

					<h2 className="py-4"> My Work Style:</h2>

					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						I work well with others and can quickly adapt to new teams and
						tools. I believe that good communication,
						a growth mindset, and a positive attitude under pressure are just as
						important as technical skills. Whether working remotely or onsite, I
						bring high energy, reliability, and a desire to grow always.
					</p>

					<h2 className="py-4"> Beyond the Code:</h2>

					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						Outside tech, I’m passionate about languages and cultures. I speak
						fluent English, have developed strong proficiency in Finnish, and
						enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. To recharge,
						I stay active: whether it’s playing football, lifting at the gym, or
						enjoying long summer jogs through the parks — I make time for
						wellness and balance.
					</p>

					<h2 className="py-4"> Let’s Build Something Great:</h2>

					<p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
						I’m currently open to new opportunities in front-end development. If
						you’re looking for a developer who’s passionate about both clean
						code and great design, feel free to reach out directly.
